So today is the day I publicly announced [PlayFree][playfree] for the first time! Up to this point, it has just been private parties I have told about the site.

The site can be kind of complicated if you have not been told how it works, and hopefully in time the site will become more intuitive. For now, while it's still hard to catch on, I hope to write some helpful notes about the functionality PlayFree provides.

- A user can search PlayFree to find venues that have free games
    - There are many ways to find a venue you're looking for or in the area you have searched, by:
        1. Venue name, City, State, Zip, Phone
        2. Game type (pool, darts, etc)
- If a venue that has free games is not on the site when you search for it, you can submit it as a new venue
    - Once submitted, the venue can be instantly found if searched. It will appear in the "Unverified" tab of the search results page
    - Once an admin verifies the venue, it will be removed from the "Unverified" list and be added to the "Verified" list
- A venue (verified or unverified) can be edited by anyone
    - Edited verified venues will create a copy of itself and add it to the "Unverified" list with the changes
    - Edited unverified venues will modify the unverified venue itself, and not create any copies of itself

I think that is a decent rundown of the workflows available to public users of the site. I believe this will be an extremely useful tool once there is enough data in the system to draw repeated visits from users. I definitely plan on using it when I travel! I am always going to choose a place that provides a free game, and in turn I will be willing to buy more food, drinks, etc. from them. I see this as a win-win opportunity for us and venues alike! In the future I plan to offer venues premium spots in the list of search results, so if their venue appears it will be at the top of the page.

So if you know of some venues that host free games, head on over to [PlayFree][playfree] and enter them in! Keep in mind this is a project I've been working on in my free time, and there are still improvements in development. As a result, if you find any bugs or have ideas to help make the site better, please don't hesitate to send me an email (found below).

Enjoy PlayFree!
