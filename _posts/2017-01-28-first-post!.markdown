Well this is my first blog post, as you probably already know by being here. I am currently sitting in my hotel room after just losing out of the B division 8 ball WSPA (Wsiconsin Pool Players Association) state tournament.

I was knocked into the loser side of the event this morning around 2:15 AM. I got a break and run, then mis-cued to lose one game and the rest was history. Today, I missed a straight in 8 ball hill hill and ended up losing that game to be defeated.

Shooting that 8 ball shot will be a terror that will hopefully teach me to take more time, and breathe next time. But the positive thing here is, there WILL BE a next time!

Anyway, I had to write a post to kick off this website, so I hope you enjoyed it. Hopefully I'll have some more posts and a little nicer looking site soon. Head over and check out [PlayFree][playfree] to find some free games or share your knowledge of where there are free games. I will write a nice blog post about PlayFree soon to describe the process it has undergone and a nice description of what it is and how to use it.

Best of luck!
