My name is Tommy Treb and I am a software developer. I love thinking up new ideas and bringing them to life with code. I also have the same love (and sometimes hate) for the game of billiards. It is just too fun.

This image is me shooting a shot at a state tournament. The poster is a birthday gift from my girlfriend Jeanna Diedrich. A friend of ours designed it, and I can't think of a cooler gift! The full image can be viewed [here][movie-poster-full] where all of the text is readable, if you're interested.

I am a pretty laid back dude. When I'm not programming or playing pool I like to play video games. Currently Playerunknown's Battlegrounds has been my go-to. It's unlike anything I have ever played, and it's insanely fun.

My interests when it comes to programming include Python, NodeJS, ReactJS, KnockoutJS, and MongoDB. These are what I've been dipping my toes into for the past 2 years and I've loved it! I've got a few projects you can take a look at on my [projects][projects] page that use these technologies.

I enjoy doing back-end development the most, just because sometimes front-end can be stubborn when dealing with the UI. I have however been improving my skills in this area and it is making a difference in my enjoyment (with html at least).
