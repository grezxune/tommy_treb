My name is Tommy Treb and I am a software developer. I love generating innovative ideas and putting them to work with code. I also have the same love (and sometimes hate) for the game of billiards. It is just too fun.

If you can't tell by the images on this beautiful site, I am a pretty laid back dude. When I'm not programming, or playing pool I like to play video games. Currently Playerunknown's Battlegrounds has been my go-to. It's unlike anything I have ever played, and it's insanely fun.

My interests when it comes to programming include Python, NodeJS, ReactJS, KnockoutJS, and MongoDB. These are what I've been dipping my toes into for the past 2 years and I've loved it! I've got a few projects you can take a look at on my [projects][projects] page that use these technologies.

I enjoy doing back-end development the most, just because sometimes front-end can be stubborn when dealing with the UI. I have however been improving my skills in this area and it is making a difference in my enjoyment (with html at least).
