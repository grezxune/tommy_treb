# Thinking Of Projects

This seems to be the easy part. As a software developer who has a passion for creating my own projects, I'm always coming up with new ideas for a program of some sort. The problem is deciding which idea has enough value or potential to actually start developing, and it doesn't even stop there. I can start any number of projects, but perhaps the hardest part of this dilemma is actually FINISHING a project. There's many factors into why this is - lack of time, loss of motivation, scope creep, realizing the idea wasn't that great, etc., that list goes on and on. 

# Choose The Small Ones

Recently, I've been tackling some smaller projects that have some purpose, and have a small enough scope that they can be finished in a reasonable amount of time. It has been really rewarding, and I've gotten to publish some new apps out on the web in a short period. I also developed a program at work to help me and my co-workers with efficiency, it allows a user to assign a key combination to perform an action such as login, launch any executable, and a few other actions as of now (it's really cool!).
